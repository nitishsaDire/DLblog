            "content": "Introduction . We have seen in the last post that each neuron has weights, bias, and an activation function associated with it. It receives inputs $x_i$, each input $x_i$ is multiplied with weight $w_i$, and bias $b$ is added to the final product, therefore $sum = Sigma{(w_i.x_i)} + b$. Now activation function $ phi()$ is applied on the sum, so $y = phi( Sigma{(w_i.x_i)} + b )$. . If $w$ is a vector where $i^{th}$ value is $w_i$, and $x$ is vector where $i^{th}$ value is $x_i$, then $ Sigma{(w_i.x_i)} + b$ could be written as $w.x^T + b$. There output from a neuron is $ phi( w.x^T + b)$. . Need for the activation function . Suppose there are two neurons, one after another, and the output of the first is input to the second neuron, and there are no activation functions involved. Then, . $y_1 = w_1.x^T + b_1$ . $y_2 = w_2.{y_1}^T + b_2$ . If we substitute $y_1$ in second equation RHS then these both could be written together in a single equation as: $y_2 = w.x^T + b$, where $w = w_2.w_1$ and $b = w_2.b_1 + b_2$. . Therefore, we have replaced 2 linear layers with a single linear layer by changing the weights and bias as mentioned. This could be done even if we have 100s of linear layers stacked upon one another, thus, no matter how deep our network is we can re-write it as a single layer network. If we introduce a non-linear layer in between every 2 linear layers, then we can&#39;t replace them with a single neuron. Now each linear layer is actually somewhat decoupled from the other ones and can do its own useful work. . The addition of a non-linear layer or an activation function increases the power of a neural network. By power I mean our network could approximate any function (neural network could be seen as a function which maps an input $x$ to an output $y$), with accuracy as good as we want, all we have to do is to find the right set of weights and biases to do it. This fact is mathematically proven as a universal approximation theorem. . A single nonlinearity with two linear layers is enough to approximate any function. So why would we use deeper models? The reason is performance. With a deeper model (that is, one with more layers) we do not need to use as many parameters; it turns out that we can use smaller matrices with more layers, and get better results than we would get with larger matrices and few layers.$^{**}$ . Some commonly used activation functions . Sigmoid . A sigmoid function is defined as: . $sigmoid(x) = frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$ . x = np.linspace(-7,7,100) y = 1/(1 + np.exp(-x)) fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,5)) ax.plot(x, y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f5f54fbd278&gt;] . So, a sigmoid function squashes any real number in the range $(0,1)$, therefore, interpretable as probabilities. One of the big disadvantages of the sigmoid function is that its output is not zero-centered, which will be input to the next layer. . The problem if input data is not zero-centered data: . Mostly input data is +ve, so if $a = WX + b$, and $X$ is +ve, then the gradient of $W$ is +ve, or -ve, depending on the value $ frac{ partial{L}}{ partial{a}}$. So if optimal $W$ has both +ve and -ve values, but we end up searching for sub-optimal $W$. in case of 2-d, if $W_{opt}$ lies in $2^{nd}$ or $4^{th}$ quadrant, but we are only searching only in $1^{st}$ and $3^{rd}$ quadrant. . Another issue that saturated values kill the gradients during backpropagation, means that when input is a big positive or a negative number, then the slope of sigmoid in that region is very close to 0. So, in backpropagation, it gives a gradient close to 0 to its previous layers, and therefore very small or practically no weight-updation is performed on the network, thus network stops training. This is vanishing gradient problem. . Tanh . This is a hyperbolic tangent function with the range in (-1, 1), which makes it zero centered, a benefit over sigmoid. . y = np.tanh(x) fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,5)) ax.plot(x, y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f5f54f6bfd0&gt;] . In tanh also, saturated values kill the gradients during backpropagation, and therefore vanishing gradient problem still exists. . RELU . It is the most widely used activation function which is surprisingly mathematically simpler than sigmoid, or tanh, and mostly gives better results than them. It is defined as: . $RELU(x) = max(x,0)$ . y = np.maximum(x,0) fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,5)) ax.plot(x, y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f5f52ce7eb8&gt;] . Some of the key points regarding RELU are: . Doesn’t saturate in the +ve region. | Computationally efficient to compute. | Convergence is faster. | Not zero centered outputs. | Gradient saturation in the negative half. | RELU has one major issue that it suffers from the problem of dying RELU, in which a RELU unit always outputs 0. As gradient is 0 when output is 0, therefore no weights updation happens, so the weights remain the same and RELU is very less likely to recover from this during the course of training. Dying RELU happens when there is a large grad flow and $W$ becomes big -ve numbers. . Leaky RELU . Tries to solve the dying RELU problem by having some slop for -ve input. It is defined as: . $RELU(x) = max(x, alpha*x)$, where $ alpha$ is generally a small +ve number in $(0,1)$. . y = np.maximum(x, 0.1*x) fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (5,5)) ax.plot(x, y) . [&lt;matplotlib.lines.Line2D at 0x7f5f52c4ca58&gt;] . All activation functions together . x = np.linspace(-5,5, 100) sig = 1/(1 + np.exp(-x)) tanh = np.tanh(x) x = np.linspace(-2,2, 100) relu = np.maximum(x, 0) lrelu = np.maximum(x, 0.1*x) fig,ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (10,7)) ax.plot(x, sig, marker = &#39;+&#39;, label = &#39;sigmoid&#39;) ax.plot(x, tanh, marker = &#39;.&#39;, label = &#39;tanh&#39;) ax.plot(x, relu, linestyle = &#39;--&#39;, label = &#39;RELU&#39;) ax.plot(x, lrelu, linestyle = &#39;:&#39;, label = &#39;Leaky RELU&#39;) ax.legend() ax.grid(which=&#39;major&#39;, axis=&#39;both&#39;, linestyle=&#39;:&#39;, linewidth = 1, color=&#39;b&#39;) . Conclusion . Activation Functions are the way to add non-linearity to our neural networks, and it is because of them that a fairly deep neural network is useful for complex functions representations, otherwise, it would be as good as a single layer neural network. I have included most of the commonly used activation functions, but there are many more. . $^{**}$credits: Fast.ai .",

            "title": "Deep Learning Introduction",
            "content": "Introduction . Deep Learning is a technique to extract and transform data from an input dataset, by using a deep network of neural network layers. By deep means that the number of layers is huge, could be as big as 100s of layers. Layers in any deep neural network are in one of the following categories: . Input Layer: This is the layer where the input is applied to the network. | Hidden Layers: These are all the layers between the input layer and the output layer of a neural network. Each layer has multiple neurons (described in the next section). A neuron applies weights (linear function) to the input received and directs it through an activation function (non-linear function). Each hidden layer receives input as the output of the previous layer, applies transformations on the input, and gives output to the next layer. | Output Layer: This layer computes the output of the network in the format we want. E.g. In classification problem if there are C classes, then generally output layer gives a C length vector containing probabilities for each class, and we predict the class with the highest probability. | . The output of the neural network is compared against the true-output, and a loss-value is calculated using a loss function. . A loss function takes input as the network&#39;s output $( hat{y})$ and true-output$(y)$ and computes a scalar value which depicts our happiness or unhappiness with the result. E.g. If we have 5 classes, i.e. $C=5$, and we get $y=2$, but $ hat{y}=1$, it means that our network classifies input into class 2, but the ground truth showing input of class 1. To give feedback of our unhappiness to the network our loss value should be a high positive number. If $ hat{y} = y$ then our loss should be 0. High positive loss value means unhappiness and vice-versa because the network tries to minimize the loss value, as we will see in the next sections. . An image of a neural network, with 3 hidden layers (which is not so deep) is shown below. Here each node is a neuron and edges are weights. . . Neuron . A neuron is the fundamental block of a neural network. Each neuron has weights, bias, and an activation function associated with it, as shown in the figure below. It receives inputs $x_i$, each input $x_i$ is multiplied with weight $w_i$, and bias $b$ is added to the final product, therefore $sum = Sigma{(w_i.x_i)} + b$. Now activation function $ phi()$ is applied on the sum, so $y = phi( Sigma{(w_i.x_i)} + b )$. Some most commonly used activation functions are RELU, sigmoid, etc. . . Parameters Updation . When we feed an input into the neural network then it gives output $ hat{y}$. Let&#39;s have $y$ as ground truth label, and loss is $L = f(y, hat{y})$, where $f()$ is our loss function. We know that layer $L_i$ takes input as an output of layer $L_{i-1}$, which in turn takes input from the output of layer $L_{i-2}$, and so on. The point is that layer $L_i$ output depends on all the layers before it. Therefore the final neural network output $y$ could be thought of as a complex function taking all the network parameters (weights and bias of all neurons of all the layers) as input to that function. Mathematically, if $N()$ is a neural network function involving all parameters, and input is x, then loss $L = f(y, N(x))$ . Now we can compute derivatives of L w.r.t. to each parameter of neural network, $ frac{ partial{L}}{ partial(p)}$, for all parameters p of the network. $ frac{ partial{L}}{ partial(p)}$ gives the direction of the steepest ascent of the loss L w.r.t. to parameter p, which means the direction in which if we little bit change p then the value of L will increase the most. Therefore if we move p in the exact opposite direction then that will be the steepest descent direction, and so L will decrease the most. So, we can update parameter p as: $p = p - alpha frac{ partial{L}}{ partial(p)}$, where $ alpha$ is known as the learning rate, the length of the step we have taken in the steepest descent direction. . This is known as the classic Gradient Descent Algorithm for parameters updation. We can update all the parameters in a similar way, i.e. by computing gradient of loss L w.r.t. to a parameter, and then applying Gradient Descent Algorithm . Network Training . Suppose we have set of n training examples as $ {(x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ... , (x_n, y_n) }$, where $x_i$ is the $i^{th}$ training example and $y_i$ is the true class label for $i^{th}$ training example. We can initialize all the network parameters with randomly small values, and update them after each iteration. The first training step could be defined as: . Computing neural network output on $x_1$. | Computing loss as $f(y_1, hat{y_1})$, where $ hat{y_1}$ is class predicted by the neural network. | We compute gradients for all the network parameters and update their values so as to minimize the loss. | . Keep on repeating all the above steps for all the training examples, until the loss converges. Going through all the training examples for once is known as 1 epoch. We can continue to train for multiple epochs until the loss converges. . Once training is done, we&#39;ll end up with such network weights which are far better than initial random weights in prediction, and we can use the same weights for inference on new unseen data. . Conclusion . I have covered a very basic understanding of deep learning models and terminology. In practice, the models which are deployed in production are very advanced and different, but the fundamental ideas remain the same. We will delve into a lot more deep learning topics in later posts. .",
